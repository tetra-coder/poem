Whose chocolate is that? I think I know.
Its owner is quite happy though.
Full of joy like a vivid rainbow,
I watch him laugh. I say hello.

He gives his chocolate a shake,
And laughs until his belly aches.
The only other sound's the break,
Of distant waves and eagles awake.

The chocolate is sweet, little and deep,
But he has promises to keep,
After cake and lots of snoozing.
Sweet dreams come to him cheap.

He wakes from his soft bed,
With thoughts of kittens in his head,
He eats his jam with lots of bread.
Ready for the day ahead.
